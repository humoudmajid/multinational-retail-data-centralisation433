# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation
This project focuses on increasing proficiency in data cleaning and extraction through the application of the Pandas module in Python. Subsequently, the cleaned data is then transferred to a PostgreSQL database. The schema is then developed into a star based schema and it is then queried using PostreSQL to fit different scenarios.
<br/>
